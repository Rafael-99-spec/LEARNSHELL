##  Variables  
Shell variables are created once they are assigned a value. A variable can contain a number, a character or a string of characters. Variable name is case sensitive and can consist
of a combination of letters and the underscore "_". Value assignment is done using the "=" sign. Note that no space permitted on either side of = sign when initializing variables.
